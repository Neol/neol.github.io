<blockquote>
<p lang="en">The underlying approach, the engineering approach, isn’t something you need to ask them [clients] about. I remember when we were switching from using tables for layout to CSS, back in the Standards days, and people were asking: ‘How do I convince my client?’ I said don’t. Just do it. Why should they care how you’re building it as long as you’re building something that meets their needs?</p>
