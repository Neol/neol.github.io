layout: pattern
category: text
name: u
usage: Represents a span of text with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation, such as labeling the text as being a proper name in Chinese text (a Chinese proper name mark), or labeling the text as being misspelt. Authors are encouraged to avoid using the <code>u</code> element where it could be confused for a hyperlink.
